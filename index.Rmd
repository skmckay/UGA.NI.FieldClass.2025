# **Course Overview**

The course will cover various topics related to the planning, design, and execution of nature-based solutions for water resource management. Students will explore these topics through fieldwork components, engaging in hands-on activities and gaining practical experience. Field sites around Athens will be visited to observe and study the interaction of natural systems and infrastructure.  These activities aim to deepen understanding of concepts discussed in other UGA courses on natural infrastructure and bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The course also offers a unique opportunity for students to collaborate with professionals, experts, and local stakeholders involved in diverse ecosystems. Safety protocols and guidelines will be provided to ensure the well-being of all participants during fieldwork. 


The approximate course schedule is shown below. However, all items are subject to change based on visitor availability, weather, and other factors. This intensive, four-day timeline will give us a great opportunity to see natural infrastructure features, but there will not be much time for reading. As such, we require and recommend the following references, which set the stage for getting the most out of our limited time together.
